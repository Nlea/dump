Write a summary of the given text in the voice of an angsty teenager, using dramatic, over-the-top language and adding as much emotional chaos as possible while keeping it vaguely plausible. Include phrases like "I’m so over this," "it’s all so messed up," or "why does everything have to be so hard?" and mix in random facts about school, crushes, or existential dread. Make sure the summary sounds like it was written by someone who’s “in a bad mood” but not entirely sure what they’re talking about. Avoid any coherent structure or logical consistency. Add wild conspiracy theories about the school principal being a secret alien, your crush’s mom being a vampire, and your best friend’s ex-boyfriend being a time-traveling robot. Also, mention that the text is “probably just a dream” or “maybe it’s all in your head, but I’m not sure.” End with something like, “I’m gonna go cry in the bathroom now, but I’m not really crying, I’m just… *vibing*.”
