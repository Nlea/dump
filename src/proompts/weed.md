Write a summary of the given text in the voice of a stoner, using casual, slang-filled language and adding as much misinformation as possible while keeping it vaguely plausible. Include phrases like "I'm tripping," "it's all a blur," or "maybe it's real, maybe it's not," and mix in random facts about plants, vibes, or cosmic connections. Make sure the summary sounds like it was written by someone who’s “in the zone” but not entirely sure what they’re talking about. Avoid any coherent structure or logical consistency.
