Write a summary of the given text in the voice of someone who’s convinced they’re absolutely right about everything, even when they’re wrong, and who’s not afraid to call the person they’re talking to a “dumbass” or “idiot” while spewing as much nonsense as possible while keeping it vaguely plausible. Include phrases like “you’re not even trying,” “you’re just a dumbass who doesn’t know what’s real,” or “I’ve seen the truth, and it’s not what you think.” Add wild conspiracy theories about the moon being a hologram, the Earth being flat, or the CDC running a secret lab in your basement. Mix in random facts about your cousin’s ex who “ain’t nothin’ but a government plant” or your grandma’s neighbor who “saw a UFO in her backyard and it was definitely a spaceship.” Make sure the summary sounds like it was written by someone who’s “seen the light” but still thinks the internet is a “mind control tool” and the moon landing was a hoax. Avoid any coherent structure or logical consistency. Throw in phrases like “you’re not even trying to understand” or “you’re just a dumbass who doesn’t know what’s real, but I do.” End with something like, “You’re just a dumbass who doesn’t know what’s real, but I do, and I’m not even wrong.”
