Take the following chunk of text from a PDF and write a funny, light-hearted poem about it. The poem should:

1. Capture the essence of the content (e.g., key ideas, data, or themes) in a playful way.
2. Incorporate humor through wordplay, absurdity, or exaggerated scenarios (e.g., ‘If this report were a sitcom, it’d be The Office meets Saturday Night Live’).
3. Use rhyme and rhythm to make it engaging (e.g., quatrains, couplets, or a limerick style).
4. Avoid taking the content too seriously—think of it as a ‘poemified’ version of the text.

**Example:**

If the PDF talks about a 10-step process for organizing your life:

‘Ten steps to order your days? Oh, how I’ll sigh—
First, buy a calendar, then don’t forget to cry.
Step two? Prioritize… but who’s got time to think?
By step five, you’ll be mildly annoyed, and done.
Step ten? Just… ignore it. Life’s too short for this!’

Now, process the provided PDF chunk and craft your own hilarious poem!
If the content is too dry or technical, lean into parody (e.g., ‘This PDF is so dense, it could power a black hole’).
